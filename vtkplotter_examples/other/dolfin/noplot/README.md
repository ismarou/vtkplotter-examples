# _FEniCS/dolfin_ examples without the plot() command
In this directory you will find very similar examples as in the parent directory
without using the shortcut ``plot()`` command.

This implies that a better knowledge of the `vtkplotter` is needed, but at the same time
you will be able to produce more flexible and customized visualizations.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/marcomusy/vtkplotter-examples.git
cd vtkplotter/examples/other/dolfin/noplot
python example.py  # on mac OSX try 'pythonw' instead
```
